# CSharp Bank Accounts Swing Application

A Tutorial on CSharp object oriented Window Form Application that demonstrates  Inheritance,  Is-a Relationship through inheritance, polymorphism and aggregation.

## CSharp Inheritance: Is-a Relationship

Is-a relationship indicates that A class Is a subclass of another class. Is-a relationship promotes code reuse that is the basic advantage of Object Oriented Programming.

For example: A Person is a base class, A Student is a subclass. Now the student is a Person also. Polymorphism provides another advantage where child classes can override the base class methods and provide their own functionality.

## Aggregation

A Bank class is implemented to serve as a controller and collection class for the
accounts that manges the transactions and accounts using Collections.
