# CSharp Programs - Desktop GUI Series
---------------------------------------------

Program to Generate Random Data Set for a given Range and
number of elements input by the User. The program then
calculate Mean, Mode, Median and Display the #Histogram. 


## Plan:
Generate Data Set, Random data set, Number of elements, Lower Limit, Upper Limit, Histogram using Bar Chart

* Function to generate Data
* Function Sort - Simple sorting algorithm
* Function to calculate Mean (Average)
* Function to determine Median:  
    Of odd number of elements: Central value
        e.g 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Median = 3
    Of Even number of elements: Central Average
        e.g 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Median (3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5
* Mode: Most Frequent Value To do we generate a Frequency of numbers
* Histogram: Created from The frequency Array.
